Skoex is developing an innovative solution for schools to enhance student safety during emergencies. The system provides a connected door-stop mechanism that can be utilized in scenarios where students need to secure themselves quickly. The solution involves a pole that students place under the door handle to physically restrict entry. When the pole is removed from its designated wall mount, a signal is automatically transmitted to notify authorities or responders, ensuring a swift reaction to potential threats.

We are currently evaluating the most suitable wireless technology to ensure reliable signal transmission. The options under consideration include NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) and LoRaWAN. NB-IoT offers the advantage of transmitting signals directly over the internet using CAT-M or NB-IoT protocols, which allows for straightforward integration with external systems via HTTP requests. On the other hand, LoRaWAN requires an intermediary layer to process and forward messages due to its network architecture.

Our goal is to select the technology that provides the most consistent and efficient communication path for ensuring the safety of students during emergencies. This decision will take into account factors such as network reliability, ease of integration, and coverage capability to meet the specific demands of the educational environment.
